## 🏛️ Component Architecture

Our component philosophy is built upon **Shadcn UI**. This means we do not have a traditional component library dependency. Instead, we use the Shadcn CLI to add individual, unstyled component primitives to our codebase, which we can then fully own and customize.

This leads to three main categories of components:

### 1. `ui/` - The Building Blocks
This directory holds the primitive, highly reusable components, most of which are generated by Shadcn UI.
*   **Examples:** `Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `Dialog.tsx`.
*   **Purpose:** These are the fundamental pieces of our design system. They are application-agnostic and can be used anywhere.
*   **Guideline:** When you need a new basic UI element, first check if it can be added via `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]`.

### 2. `dashboard/` - Composite Dashboard Components
This directory contains larger components that are composed of the `ui/` primitives and are specific to the authenticated user experience.
*   **Examples:** `RecruiterNavbar.tsx`, `SeekerNavbar.tsx`, `CandidateListDialog.tsx`.
*   **Purpose:** These components often contain business logic, state management, and are tailored to a specific dashboard (Seeker or Recruiter).
*   **Guideline:** If a component is only used within the `/dashboard` routes, it belongs here.

### 3. `landing/` - Public Page Components
This directory holds components that are used exclusively on the public-facing landing page.
*   **Examples:** `Hero.tsx`, `Features.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx` (the public one).
*   **Purpose:** These components are often heavily styled, may include animations (`framer-motion`), and are focused on marketing and user acquisition.
*   **Guideline:** If a component is only used on the main `page.tsx`, it belongs here.

## Workflow

### Adding a New UI Component

1.  **Use the Shadcn CLI** to add a new primitive to the `ui/` directory:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
    ```
2.  The command will add `dialog.tsx` to `components/ui/`. You can now customize its styles in that file to match our brand.

### Creating a New Custom Component

1.  **Identify its purpose.** Is it a small, reusable primitive? Place it in `ui/`. Is it specific to a dashboard? Place it in `dashboard/`.
2.  **Build your component** by composing existing primitives from the `ui/` directory.
3.  **Keep it focused.** Each component should have a single responsibility. If it becomes too complex, break it down into smaller components.
